Hand Tracking Piano Simulator
This project utilizes computer vision and hand tracking to create an interactive piano simulator. By detecting finger movements through a webcam, users can play different piano notes corresponding to their finger tips.
Features
•	Real-time Hand Tracking: Utilizes MediaPipe to track hand movements with high accuracy.
•	Interactive Piano Sounds: Each finger tip (thumb, index, middle, ring, and pinky) corresponds to a specific piano note.
•	Sound Playback: Uses Pygame for sound playback, allowing users to hear the notes as they interact with the system.
Requirements
•	Python 3.x
•	OpenCV
•	MediaPipe
•	Pygame
•	NumPy
You can install the required libraries using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pygame numpy
Getting Started
1.	Create a Virtual Environment: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command to create a virtual environment (replace venv with your preferred environment name):
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
2.	Activate the Virtual Environment:
o	Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
o	macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
3.	Install Required Libraries: Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pygame numpy
4.	Add Piano Sound Files: Ensure you have the piano sound files (e.g., tone1.mp3, tone2.mp3, etc.) stored in a designated folder on your computer.
5.	Run the Code: Execute the script in your terminal:
bash
Copy code
python hand_tracking_piano.py
6.	Interact: Position your hand in front of the webcam. As you move your fingers, the corresponding piano notes will be played.
7.	Exit: Press the Esc key to close the application.
Code Overview
•	Imports: The project imports necessary libraries, including OpenCV for video capture, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and Pygame for sound playback.
•	Hand Tracking Setup: Initializes MediaPipe hand tracking with specified parameters for detection.
•	Sound Mapping: A dictionary maps finger tips to specific piano note files.
•	Main Loop: The main loop captures video frames, processes them to detect hand landmarks, and plays corresponding sounds based on finger movements.
•	Movement Detection: Implements logic to play a sound only when a finger tip moves significantly from its previous position.
